# Home-Server-Documentation
Tore everything down when I moved, now starting from scratch. I plan on working out a system to share processing power from my main desktop with the thin clients, while still running 24/7. We'll see how this turns out. Also swapping to Ubuntu Server for the thin clients over Linux Mint/Windows Server.
